On this particular project, I've been working side-by-side with the backend team while converting our current client-side app to server-side, emphasizing the importance of the Core Web Vitals, code performance and metrics like TTI and FCP. The side-projects also continue, so Dynamite has been undergoing some updates to include Typescript and Vue.js.</p><section class="side-project"><h5>Project: Mail</h5><p>The latest project I'm currently working on it's an Express.js API, done with Node.js and Typescript. The API endpoint is a SMTP e-mail server for our live A/B test reports and other internal tools.</p></section></div><a href="#" class="read-more-btn">read more</a></article><article><header><h3>Dell Technologies</h3><span>01.2019 - 04.2020</span></header><div class="read-more"><h4>Senior Analyst Software Engineer</h4><p>Moving to a senior position in 2019, I guide and help the development team into creating new features, fixing bugs and collaborating. Also, Dell encourage it's collaborators to use it's spare time to work on side projects. So here are my highlights so far:</p><section class="side-project"><h5>Project: Dynamite</h5><p>Dynamite came from the need to automate, initally just a few tasks on our daily dev job, but it's an ever increasing project as of today. We use Adobe Target to manipulate and deliver A/B tests on multiple plataforms, and Dynamite acts as a pipeline tool, responsible to lint and parse the code, adding CSS prefixes, checking the template, creating an exclusive sandbox environment and making sure the code is ready to go. Also, it makes use of Adobe Target REST API to send the code to the plataform. The tool has been designed and built by me using Node.js, Electron and lots of Javascript.</p></section><section class="side-project"><h5>Project: Internal lib for testing</h5><p>Since the A/B tests run on the front-end layer of the website, our team needs an exclusive library for handling metrics, data, code and performance. I was able to join the project, collaborating to solve issues related to performance and integrating the lib alongside Dynamite. I was also responsible for converting the tool into vanilla Javascript.</p></section></div><a href="#" class="read-more-btn">read more</a></article><article><header><h3>Dell Technologies</h3><span>03.2017 - 01.2019</span></header><h4>Analyst Software Engineer</h4><p>Dell's assignment has been the vastest and most relevant in my career so far. Here, I've been working with A/B tests on the front-end layer of the website, using Javascript - and jQuery -, CSS3, and HTML5 to customize the experience to the users. Dell has a lot of micro front-end teams, so I have to adjust my code to work alongside Vue.js, Angular, Knockout, and other internal JS frameworks. My responsibilities also include peer reviewing and supporting other colleagues from US, India, and Brazil daily.</p></article><article><header><h3>Farol</h3><span>07.2015 - 01.2017</span></header><h4>Co-Founder and Front-end Developer</h4><p>Farol was an initiative alongside two other colleagues from college. We opened a small business where design and user experience was a priority. There my focus was on meeting with and presenting ideas for clients, and being the principal front-end developer (I was responsible for defining technologies, project structures and building the pages). Here I was free to start experiencing new technologies, such as SASS, CSS animations and SVG, flex display, Angular.js and responsive designs.</p></article><article><header><h3>WPlay</h3><span>05.2014 - 05.2015</span></header><h4>Front-end Developer</h4><p>WPlay was a marketing agency where I started to focus solely on front-end development. I worked on a team with peers, designers and back-end developers.</p></article><article><header><h3>G4 Art</h3><span>07.2012 - 05.2014</span></header><h4>Full-stack Developer</h4><p>My first job was on a local marketing agency, where I worked alongside a designer and a back-end developer. I was usually assigned as the responsible developer for a project where I would design it, develop the front-end and then the back-end. On my spare time, I also did product and graphic design assets needed for other projects.</p></article></section></div></main><footer title="Try printing this page into a PDF! ðŸ˜‰">developed by me <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20.51" height="19.808" viewBox="0 0 20.51 19.808"><g id="flower-doodle-outline" transform="translate(0 -7.944)"><g id="Group_1" data-name="Group 1" transform="translate(0 7.944)"><path id="Path_5" data-name="Path 5" d="M2.846,19.1C1.426,20.527.473,22.457,2.021,24.3c1.713,2.035,3.8,2.189,5.616.808.761,1.6,2.03,3.088,4.007,2.527a3.75,3.75,0,0,0,2.88-3.989,4.274,4.274,0,0,0,4.272-.815c1.676-1.434.944-3.427-.139-4.938,1.85-1.119,2.515-2.761,1.065-4.964-1.364-2.071-3.591-2.2-5.6-1.452.009-1.875-1-3.2-3.319-3.5a5.059,5.059,0,0,0-3.371.891A2.847,2.847,0,0,0,6.3,11.437,5.022,5.022,0,0,0,.54,13.708C-.972,15.956.977,17.9,2.846,19.1Zm.92-6.1a3.7,3.7,0,0,1,3.012.382.9.9,0,0,0,1.259-.962c-.147-1.734.6-2.7,2.356-2.786,2.09-.1,2.3,1.41,1.877,3.052a.847.847,0,0,0,1.234.948c1.517-.933,3.156-1.486,4.594-.066.617.61,1.231,1.873.269,2.6a7.144,7.144,0,0,1-1.427.714.847.847,0,0,0-.17,1.319c.847.939,1.933,2.123.84,3.431-.952,1.139-2.637.5-3.685-.047a.848.848,0,0,0-1.234.948c.388,1.542.252,3.247-1.714,3.5-1.313.167-1.9-1.672-2.209-2.6a.848.848,0,0,0-1.4-.37c-1.134,1.275-2.353,1.775-3.767.5-1.568-1.41-.1-2.978,1.089-3.887a.851.851,0,0,0,0-1.45c-1.116-.594-2.832-1.391-2.961-2.829C1.632,14.354,2.936,13.353,3.767,13Z" transform="translate(0 -7.944)"/><path id="Path_6" data-name="Path 6" d="M167.127,161.316a3.19,3.19,0,1,1-3.44,3.18A3.318,3.318,0,0,1,167.127,161.316Z" transform="translate(-157.325 -155.092)"/></g></g></svg></footer><script src="./source.js"></script></body></html>
